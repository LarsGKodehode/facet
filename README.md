# System Configurations

This repository contains my [NixOS] configurations.

Currently not too much to look at. Also the `modules` directory might
see some heavy changes as i figure out what parts are shared among the
different hosts.

Some of the current goals:

- Hosts
  - [ ] Weasel: Basic personal WSL configuration
  - [ ] Rock: Home server
  - [ ] Zephyrus: Personal Laptop
- Images
  - [ ] Hotrod/Straps: Bootable USB drive
- Templates
  - [ ] Rust
  - [ ] NodeJS
  - [ ] Haskell
